    <h2>Elin's Curriculum Vitae</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Elin and I am currently studying front end development at Sundsgården Folkhögskola. 
        So far, I am very pleased with the course content and with the teacher. 
        My goal is to be able to work as a junior front end developer when the education is finished in January 2022. 
        This website works as my Curriculum Vitae.
