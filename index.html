            <p>
                My name is Elin and I am currently studying front end development at Sundsgården Folkhögskola. 
                So far, I am very pleased with the course content and with the teacher. 
                My goal is to be able to work as a junior front end developer when the education is finished in January 2022. 
                This website works as my Curriculum Vitae.
